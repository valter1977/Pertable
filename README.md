This is a periodic table program, created quite some time ago (around 2011). The idea was to have a lightweight self-contained HTML/CSS/Javascript solution which would run anywhere and wouldn't require any server-side support. As a result, it loads fast and is highly interactive. Though, it may require some amendments to incorporate modern web technologies.
